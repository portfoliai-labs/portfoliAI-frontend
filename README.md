This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment variables

| Variable | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Backend base URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase auth |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public site URL (metadata); defaults to https://portfoliai.online |

### Demo accounts

An account on the `DEMO` subscription tier (`subscription_tier` on its profile) is a demo
account. On the regular dashboard it also sees the roadmap's preview features (Wallets, Real
estate, Explore, Strategy — sample data, not tied to real data), and it is read-only: the
frontend refuses its writes (`app/lib/demo.ts`) and disables the controls that would send them.
The backend must refuse a demo account's writes as well; the frontend alone can be bypassed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
