 * (WealthRoot: investments and wallets together); a client's Wealth, which has no wallets, on the
 * investments, which are "All portfolios" while they have two or more, otherwise their only portfolio.
 *
 * A portfolio's page (PortfolioNode) is its header (value, activity, actions, key figures) over
 * its Insights (PerformanceSection), whose Composition leads down to each portfolio (from All
 * portfolios) or holding. Its activity and its actions open pages of its own, always on that
 * portfolio, so none of them asks which one: Transactions, Alerts and Reports, and on All
 * portfolios Compare and Manage portfolios. A strategy's backtest opens the same page in Plan, under
 * Strategy (a link to one here goes there). The wallets are WalletNode's pages; a demo account's
 * are sample data, and it also has the real estate portfolio, a preview.
 *
 * Every page is a browser history entry, so back and forward move between them (see
 * lib/dashboardHistory). Opening a portfolio also makes it the selected one (PortfolioContext).
 *
 * An advisor's client's Wealth is the same pages (see ClientsSection): in the Clients section, each
 * view carrying the client (`scope`), under the client's crumbs (`rootTrail`), on that client's
 * portfolios (a PortfolioProvider of theirs), with no previews.
