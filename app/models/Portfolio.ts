// Matches TransactionsSummaryResponse / PortfolioOverviewResponse DTOs (GET /v1/portfolios/{p}/overview)

// Matches PortfolioResponse (GET/POST/PATCH /v1/portfolios, GET /v1/portfolios/{p},
// GET/POST /v1/advisor/clients/{client_uuid}/portfolios) — a user can own several of these
// (e.g. "Main portfolio", "Pensione", "Trading"); every dashboard/transactions/alerts/reports
// endpoint is scoped to one via its uuid in the path. Every user (including advisor-created
// clients, advisors themselves, and demo accounts) has exactly one `isDefault` portfolio,
// created at registration and never deletable (DELETE on it is a 409). While a user owns 2+
// portfolios they also get an automatic `isAggregate` one ("All portfolios"): its figures are
// recomputed from every portfolio's transactions combined, it's readable everywhere (incl.
// alert rules) but otherwise read-only — transaction writes, import commit, reports, rename
// and delete all 409. GET /v1/portfolios returns the aggregate first (if any), then the
// default, then oldest first; an advisor lists a client's the same way via
// GET /v1/advisor/clients/{client_uuid}/portfolios, then reaches each through the same
// /v1/portfolios/{p}/... paths the client would.
//
// `isVirtual` marks a portfolio the backend puts together rather than one the user writes: the
// aggregate is one, and so is a strategy's backtest (POST /v1/portfolios/strategies, see
// models/Strategy). Neither takes transactions, imports or reports (409). A backtest can be
// renamed and deleted like a standard portfolio, and it isn't one of the aggregate's members:
// it's simulated money, never counted in the user's wealth.
